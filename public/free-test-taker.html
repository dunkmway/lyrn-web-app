      <h1>Worried about getting into college?</h1>
      <p>
        Getting into college can be seriously stressful - trust us, we've been there. Between finding the right college, 
        getting good enough scores and grades to get in, spending the time and money to apply, and being unsure if you're 
        qualified, it adds up to a lot of wasted sleep and stress!
      </p>
      <p>
        While the ACT isn't the only qualification to get into college, it can be a big deal for getting into your dream school.
        Getting a good score is just that much less stress on your plate, and that much more assurance that you'll get into your 
        school! But in order to do that, you need to know what you don't know. So we're offering you 2 free ACT tests to tell you 
        just that - where to improve.

        <h2>All Real ACT Questions</h2>
        <p>
          All of our questions are taken from previous ACT exams, so you can rest assured that you'll be studying the right 
          material. Over the course of all 3 tests, you'll get a feel of what the test is really going to be like!
        </p>
        <h2>Broken Into Section</h2>
        <p>
          Our tests are not only broken down into the four sections of the ACT, but are broken down beyond that, into the topics 
          tested within each section. You can see exactly what to improve! Maybe you're really good at math but need to study 
          polygons, or maybe you're weak on reading, especially when it comes to questions about natural science! Whatever it is, 
          know right away what you're good at and what you need to work on.
