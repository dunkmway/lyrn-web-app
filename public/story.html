        <h2>The right tutor makes all the difference</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Matt and this is my business partner, Duncan. We are the founders of Lyrn! We absolutely love working with students to make learning much more fun
          and enjoyable. We understand that being a student can be very difficult. Challenging classes, getting into your dream college,
          being able to afford said college are just some of the things we are here to help with!
        </p>
        <div class="quote-card">
          <p>"We have set out on the quest to make your journey more enjoyable, and help you reach your dreams."</p>
        </div>
        <p>Having a tutor can make ALL the difference between getting into the school you want, getting a scholarship, or passing a class. We have set out
          on the quest to make your journey more enjoyable and help you reach your dreams.
        </p>
        <h2>Your success is our mission</h2>
        <p>We want your student to feel the same fire and passion for learning that we do: to attend the school of their dreams, to be able to afford higher education, and to achieve
          academic and occupational success.
        </p>
        <div class="quote-card">
          <p>"We tutor your student in order to achieve their dreams by creative teaching, machine learning cirriculums, and personalized education."</p>
        </div>
        <p>Our values are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hard word</strong> - You have to put the effort in yourself, and no one can do it for you.</li>
          <li><strong>Begin with the end in mind</strong> - Set and make goals!</li>
          <li><strong>Integrity</strong> - Recognize where you are at in your progress. You can't move on until you admit where you are.</li>
          <li><strong>Productivity</strong> - There's more time for play when you get your chores done first!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>We can tutor better</h2>
        <p>Duncan and I met through tutoring. We worked at the same location; we even had some of the same students. After working together for over a year, <strong>We both decided
          that this could be better</strong>: better communication, better curriculum, better analytics, and a more advanced and individualized process. Our goal is to do our very
          best to create the perfect path for each student based on their unique circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>Since coming up with the idea, we have spent hundreds if not a few thousand hours together and separatly discussing and creating <strong>a more detailed curriculum, a 
          better tutor training process, and adaptive learning method, and a functioning web app.</strong> We create the best path your student can take based on their unique situation,
          how tutors can better communicate about your student, how your student can receive the best learning experience and can ultimately succeed academically and
          occupationally.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/Lyrn_About_2.png" alt="Working together is key.">
        <h2>The Lyrn Method</h2>
        <p>I worked in all facets of the data world from collecting, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data. Additionally, I have built many advanced ML (machine learning)
          predictive models on small to enterprise sized datasets. This led me to the idea of creating a system to better help students focus on what they need most, for a more
          effcient and powerful approach to tutoring.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to my career in data, we have also tutored for many years and have worked with a large array of students, having learned which teaching techniques and strategies
          are most effective. We have learned which topics are the most difficult or easiest to understand. We have learned how the ACT (and other test) try to trick or confuse
          students. In short, <strong>we have learned what does and doesn't work</strong> and we would like to continue progressing to give the most individualized and effective
          learning to each and every student.
        </p>

        <h2>Dream Big</h2>
        <p>We won't stop until your student achieves their dreams. We love academia but even more than that we love seeing the success of your student ace their test, get the ACT score
          they've wanted, go to the college they aimed for, and achieve their dreams. We send students to the moon, and with our program we believe we can do that for you!
