          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
          <p>Each program is designed to achieve the desired score increase within the time given. <strong>One is not better than the other.</strong> It all depends on what your student needs.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Quick improvement, small increase, 2-4 point maximum score even if the program went longer</li>
            <li>Slow improvement, large increase, 5 or more - hopefully more ðŸ˜‰</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our Initial Consultation is meant to help us 1 - determine which program makes the most sense for your student before starting a full program and 2 - prove to you that we have the best program ðŸ’ª.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Still want to know more?</strong></p>
          <p>
            Depending on which college your student is trying to apply to and what kind of scholarships they are looking for, the number of point they need to go up in the ACT will differ.
          </p>
          <p>
            For students that only need 2 to 4 points to reach their goals we reccomend the <strong>ACT Fundamentals</strong>. The fundamentals are all your student needs to improve but quick improvement comes
            with some downsides. The same program that helps students to get a quick improvement on their test is also limited by how far they can go without really getting into the nitty gritty.
            That is why the program takes less time. Any longer and your student won't see improvement. During this time, however, your student will practice, practice, practice!
            They will know the test better than they have ever known it before and will feel prepared and confident to tackle the real thing!
          </p>
          <p>
            Students who want to guarantee admission and reap the rewards of thousands of dollars of scholaship funds are facing a much more difficult challenge. A 5 point or more increase is quite
            the feat for any student and the amount of work required to get there is more than just covering the basics. For our <strong>Comprehensive ACT Program</strong>, we start from the gound up. We aren't just
            reviewing key topics that will increase your student's score, we're digging deep and truly understanding the topcis that the ACT is throwing at you. Your student will work hard and our
            tutors will be right beside them the entire time. Slow and steady progress laying strong foundations is key to reaching a 5+ increase. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately we are here to help your student achieve their goals. It's not that one program is better than the other, they both play different roles depending on your student's needs.
            That is why we highly reccomend going through our <strong>Initial Consultation</strong> first. There we can undersatnd where your student is and set realistic goals based on what colleges your student
            is interested in. It's also an opportunity for you to try us out before scheduling out a program.
