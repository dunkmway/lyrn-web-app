        <h2>Revolutionizing education</h2>
        <p>
          After years of working in the tutoring industry at various companies and privately tutoring, we wanted to make something revolutionary. We wanted
          to truly break down what we are teaching. With years of experience, we have spent hundreds of hours pouring over our curriculum
          to make sure it is the best in the world. But what truly separates us from the pack is that we are bringing education
          into the 21st century. The way to do that is through data, and we call it Adaptive Learning Intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Adaptive Learning Intelligence.</strong> We track every question your student answers in our programs; every test they take, every worksheet they complete,
          every lesson we cover will be saved and will affect every step your student takes through our truly custom programs. This is why we have spent hundreds of hours developing 
          state-of-the-art software to help your student succeed. The only way to enter the future of education is to use the tools of the future. Our tutors have this technology at 
          their finger tips, and they are eager to help your student reach their dreams.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>Your student isn't the only one learning. The best part about having a data-driven curriculum is that it only gets better and better. Our system will learn and improve with
          every question your student answers. Constant improvement is key to who we are, and we want the same from your student.
        </p>

        <h2>Advanced yet simple</h2>
        <p>We want to simplify the process as much as possible. Yes, there is some pretty crazy stuff going on under the hood, but at the end of the day if your student doesn't understand
          what they are learning then we failed. Figuring out what type of tutoring your students needs is an immense challenge for parents. This is why we have simplified tutoring to a
          few programs that are tailored to what your student needs. 
          We focus on these three things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>World Class Tutors</strong> - Our tutors not only know their stuff but can teach effectively.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Honesty from the very beginning.</li>
          <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Help ease some stress when you need it the most</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Our amazing tutors</h2>
        <p>
          Our top priority when hiring tutors is their ability to teach. This might sound obvious, but too often we see that the knowledge of the tutor is chosen over their ability 
          to teach that knowledge. Don't get me wrong, our tutors are completely prepared to answer any question and teach any concept to your students.
        </p>
        <p>
          We choose to focus on the 
          relationship they build with students and how they can best help your student. Every student is unique and needs a unique approach to learning. This is exactly the need that 
          our tutors fill. Our advanced learning intelligence helps our tutors focus less on <strong>what</strong> to teach and more about <strong>how</strong> to teach. 
        </p>
        <div class="quote-card">
          <p>"Every student is unique and needs a unique approach to learning."</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Open and Honest</h2>
        <p>We commit to being completely transparent about our services and pricing. We're excited about what we offer, so why wouldn't we want to share it? If you have any question about our services, please contact us and we will be
          more than happy to help. Transparency will extend throughout your entire time with us. We want you to know how your student is doing and you don't have to wait until the end of the program
          to hear about it. We are dedicated to keeping in touch with parents the entire time and being willing to help at any time.
        </p>
        <p>This is why we don't have any contracts with our programs. If we aren't providing the service you expected then we still want your student to get the help they need which might mean a different tutor 
          or another service. We want to make it as easy as possible so that your student can get the help they need as quickly as possible and being honest is the best way to do that.
        </p>

        <h2>Sweet and Simple</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to make the tutoring process as simple and effective as possible. Sign up whenever you need and we would love to fit you in. Being online allows us to make the entire 
          process seamless. No worrying about
          working with multiple tutors and having to juggle those meetings. We handle the entire process. Your student's tutor will be ready to help as soon as your student logs in to start the session. 
        </p>
