                undergrad at the University of Utah. I'm participating in the Utah Students Robotics club, and like to get involved 
                with a lot of the different happenings around campus. I enjoy soccer and rock climbing, and I love to come 
                up with games and projects to share with the people around me. I also deeply enjoy the process of learning, 
                and love to figure out difficult things with others. I look forward to problem-solving solving together!

                I was born and raised in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. 
                I'm currently working towards a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with an emphasis in aerospace 
                at the University of Utah. I've always been fascinated with space and space exploration which is the reason 
                I'm working to become an aerospace engineer.  When I'm not studying or working, I like to spend my freetime 
                on my longboard, on hiking trails, listening to music, or binge watching random tv shows on Netflix. 
                Just some fun facts about me: I studied French for 12 years, I can play 3 instruments including the drums, 
                I played high school basketball and competed for my school's track team, and one of my absolute favorite foods 
                is a spanish rice dish called paella.</p>
