                I'm currently working towards a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with an emphasis in aerospace 
                at the University of Utah. I've always been fascinated with space and space exploration which is the reason 
                I'm working to become an aerospace engineer.  When I'm not studying or working, I like to spend my freetime 
                on my longboard, on hiking trails, listening to music, or binge watching random tv shows on Netflix. 
                Just some fun facts about me: I studied French for 12 years, I can play 3 instruments including the drums, 
                I played high school basketball and competed for my school's track team, and one of my absolute favorite foods 
                is a spanish rice dish called paella.</p>

              <p>
                I'm from Provo Utah, born and raised! I am currently attending the Utah Valley University studying English Education. 
                After college I want to teach English as a foreign language in other countries. 
                I love to travel, bake, and play video games!

                Hi! I'm Andrew Bouc (pronounced like an oak tree with a “b” in front - “b-oak”). 
                I grew up in a suburb north of Chicago, but recently moved down to a suburb south of Dallas. 
                I can't let go of suburbia! I'm studying mechanical engineering at BYU in hopes of one day working in robotics and clean energy. 
                I love cooking and fitness. In particular have been into weightlifting the past few years. 
                I also played soccer and raced on the XC and track teams. 
                School isn't as awful as you may think - it can be really cool to understand the world around us!

              <p>
                I was born in Draper, Utah, but moved out to Aiken, South Carolina a few days after I graduated from Lone Peak High School. 
                I've nearly completed a bachelor's degree in math education at Brigham Young University, and once 
                I graduate I'm looking at teaching Geometry or Calculus. I spend most of my free time swimming, 
                designing video games/board games, and hiking. I'm also a really good cook, and specialize in classical 
                Italian dishes and Southern barbecue. My favorite food, however, is sushi, and in particular, fried eel rolls. 
                I'm excited for the opportunity to tutor you!
