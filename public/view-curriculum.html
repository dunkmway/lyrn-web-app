        <h3>Review (30 Minutes)</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this time is to review the topics that were taught last time. 
          The goal should be to have the student teach to you how to identify the topics and how to approach them.
          Do this one topic at a time. Split your time evenly between the topics. Use the questions they did for their Daily and Homework assignment.
          They should be able to demonstrate the proper way they answered correct questions and then also explain
          how to get the question they got wrong correct in the proper method.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a student did not do their homework, meaning they did not answer all question on their Daily or did not answer a sufficent
          amount of question on their homework (should be around 75 give or take 15 -ish), please let us know and we will review the homework
          and take action from their. What you can do in the mean time is create Worksheet assignments to take the place of the incomplete homework.
          Use what you have from the homework first but if you don't have enough, then use the Worksheets.
        </p>

        <h3>Learn (60 minutes)</h3>
        <p>
          This will be the bulk of the lesson where we learn new topics. You will teach the topics in the order
          that they appear under the lessons section in the new assignment page. Start with the next topic that
          hasn't been tuaght yet. The goal should be to explain to the student how to identify and appraoch the topic,
          All of this information should be memorized but if you need a reminder see the curriculum above.
          The student must show you that they understand and not merely tell you they do. Use a Worksheet assignment to 
          to get questions of the given topic. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You should start off by doing the problem for the student by showing
          how you know this question is of the given type and then properly showing the approach. Do this a few times then
          move on to holding their hand through the problem. Ask them guiding questions, "how do we know this is a _______ question,"
          "how do we begin to apporach this type of question," etc. Help them figure it out step by step. Then move on to having them
          walk through a problem out loud and explain it fully back to you. Hopefully by the time you do this a few times they should have it down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning a topic should take as long as the student needs to really understand the material. We are looking for understanding, not
          completion of the curriculum. If you have a student that is breezing through the topics then move quickly and if not then take the 
          time you need. If you are worried about how long (or short) you are taking to teach a topic let us know and we can definitly help
          you out. It will take time to really figure out the right timing for each student but early on you'll do great.
        </p>

        <h3>Practice (30 minutes)</h3>
        <p>
          This is the time for the student to practice on their own what they just learned. You should create a Practice
          assigment with all of the topics that you covered today and let them do as many questions as they can. We recommend
          letting your student work for no more than 10 minutes before jumping in to review. Reviewing is simply going over with
          the student what questions they got wrong and helping them get the correct answer. Then set them off for another Practice
          assignment. Do this until the end of the session. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This is your time to take a break! While the student is working, you can mute your mic and turn off your camera and do whatever you need to do.
          Jump back on to have the student submit the assignment and you two can begin reviewing. Don't feel like you need to be in front
          of your computer monitoring them. I would listen to see if they have questions pop up but they should do this question completely alone.
          We use this time to get an idea of how they are doing so make sure they do their very best and you not help them until the review time.
        </p>

        <h3>Assigning Homework</h3>
        <p>
          Ideally this is done while your student is practicing so that they have uninterrupted session time. Make sure to assign a Daily and a Homework
          assignment after each session. More instruction can be found for each assignment on the new assignment page. One last thing before leaving a session,
          make sure to submit any assignmnt you started in the session so that the student doesn't have those confusing them during the week.

        <h3>Review (30 Minutes)</h3>
        <p>
          We want to help the student understand their mistakes. As you review questions they got wrong make sure to not tell the them
          the answer but have them explain what they did and help them correct mistakes one step at a time. Focus first on the topics they
          learned last session and hit as many wrong questions as you can. If you run out of wrong answers, create a Worksheet assignment of the topic
          they struggled with the most and work through some questions together.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a student did not do their homework, meaning they did not answer all question on their Daily or did not answer a sufficent
          amount of question on their homework (should be around 60 give or take 20 -ish), please let us know and we will review the homework
          and take action from their. What you can do in the mean time is create Worksheet assignments to take the place of the incomplete homework.
          Use what you have from the homework first but if you don't have enough, then use the Worksheets.

          Practice, practice, practice. Instead of teaching everything they need to know for a topic, we are just going to jump right in.
          The assumption we are making is that for the majority of topics, student's should have some prior exposure to the question and
          they need only a refresher. Topcis wille be taught in the order they appear under the lessons area on the new assignment page.
          Create a Worksheet assignment for the one topic you are covering next and go through it together one by one. Let the student lead
          and help them as they get stuck. They should explaining each step out loud and you should only give hints when they are stuck. 
          If the student has no idea what to do in a problem, step back for a moment and teach the concept necessary to answer the question.
          We want to make sure the student understands the concepts and not just how to answer very specific questions. Do this until 
          you have covered enough variety that you feel the student understands the topic and can get the majority of questions correct.

          We want to help the student understand their mistakes. As you review questions they got wrong make sure to not tell the them
          the answer but have them explain what they did and help them correct mistakes one step at a time. Focus on showing the answer
          in the passage and not just giving the answer. Students should develop the habit of having a reason for an answer based
          on something they see in the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a student did not do their homework, meaning they did not answer all question on their Daily or did not answer a sufficent

          This you dedicated book club hour. Reading can only get better if we focus on comprehension. The idea behind book club
          is that a student can only answer the questions if they truly comprehend the passage first. Together with your student
          you will take turns reading a passage by creating a Worksheet assignment. Do one passage at a time. Popcorn read the 
          paragraph and ask who, what, where, when, why, and how question. Every few paragraphs ask what the main idea of the 
          passage is so far. We want your student to begin to develop the habit of engaging with the passage and not just reading
          words. They goal is that the student will begin to ask these same questions as they read on their own. Encourage your
          student to point out answers to these questions before you ever ask them. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Make it fun. We know these passages can be a little less enjoyable to read than most things, but having fun with the 
          passage will help the brain want to comprehend the passage. You student will mirror your energy so be excited about reading
          together and exploring the stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you're done reading you should answer the questions together. Let them lead and explain their thoughts. Don't help them
          get the answer, rather help them find the answer. They should be able to point out what information in the passage leads them to
          their answer. The hope is that as you read you already talked about the very thing this question is asking about.
