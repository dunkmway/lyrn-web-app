        <h2>Hiring Tutors</h2>
        <p>At Lyrn, we are dedicated to providing the most advanced tutoring to our students. This cannot be accomplished without dedicated tutors who love teaching as much as they

          schedule. We offer both subject tutoring for all general subjects and ACT tutoring. Everyone will start off tutoring in the subjects they feel
          the most comfortable in and will receive training on some if not all of the sections in the ACT.
