  <h1>Lesson Cancellation Policy</h1>
  <p>Any lesson can be cancelled any time before 9pm MDT the day before the scheduled lesson. If the lesson has already been paid for then you may choose to receive a full refund 
    or apply the payment to a future lesson. To cancel a lesson you must contact us by phone or email before the valid timeframe. Preferable send us an email so that we may 
    verify the time of the request and the lesson will not be charged the next morning. Be aware of any effect this might have upon any guarantee you may have with our programs by reviewing 
    our <a href="guarantee.html">guarantee policy</a>.
