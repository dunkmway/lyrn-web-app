  <h1>ACT Point Increase Guarantee Policy</h1>
  <h2>Score Increase</h2>
  <p>
    We compare the score you received on the official test after you completed your program with us to your baseline starting score. 
    This baseline score is set by the score you receive on your first practice test in your ACT test prep program with us. 
    This test must be taken before your first tutoring session, must be the specific test designated as the first practice test provided to you, 
    and must be taken in one sitting while observing official time limits for all sections and breaks. 
    For clarity, scores from the same practice test taken a second time will not be accepted.
  </p>

  <h2>Work you must do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You must complete the baseline test in the appropriate amount of time before starting your first sessions. This test will be provided to you.
    </li>
    <li>
      You must attend all scheduled tutoring sessions joining no later than 5 minutes after the scheduled start time and leaving no sooner than 5 minutes earlier than the scheduled end time. 
      We monitor the sessions and will be aware for what reason the student leaves. For example, if your tutor ends the meeting too early, your student is having connectivity issues, 
      or any other circumstance outside of your control, it will not be held against you if we are notified the day the lessons occurs. Any lesson can be rescheduled per our 
      <a href="cancellation.html">cancellation policy</a> within the week it would have originally occured.
    </li>
    <li>
      You must complete all homework assignments within the timeframe they are given (i.e. before the next sessions where they will be reviewed).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Taking the official test</h2>
  <p>
    You must take the first official ACT test after your last tutoring session (will be scheduled so that this test will be within a week of ending) and submit the guarantee request by contacting us within 60 days 
    after your official test date. If you registered for an official test that was to be administered within the required time frame but it was canceled, 
    you must take the next official test that is available (unless the next official test available to you is more than 90 days after your last tutoring session, 
    in which case you will need to contact us for assistance). 
  </p>

  <h2>Cheating</h2>
  <p>
    If we have reason to believe you cheated on the initial practice test, we will present this evidence to you and deny your guarantee.
  </p>

  <h2>If you do not reach the guaranteed score increase</h2>
  <p>
    If all requirements above are met and you still don't meet the score increase guarantee you may request a full refund excluding the nonrefundable deposit or
    you may repeat the program you had scheduled for free. If you choose to repeat your program no guarantee is offered.
