          <h2 style="font-size: 28px; margin:0 0 20px 0;">Reading - Focused Reading</h2>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;">
            Reading is unique on the ACT. Rather than approaching the reading section with a question based approach, we focus on strategies, 
            techniques, and comprehension. Far too often, especially with the dull and tedious passages on the ACT, what you read goes in one ear 
            and out the other. The goal of this strategy is to guide your thinking and internal processing while reading to better your comprehension.
          </p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;">
            While reading any paragraph on the ACT, you want to try and visualize what is occurring. To help with this, we suggest asking yourself who 
            is speaking? Where is this taking place? Who else is involved? What detail(s) stand out? etc. Additionally, at the end of EVERY paragraph, you 
            want to take 3 - 5 seconds to quickly identify what the main idea / purpose was. At the end of the passage, mentally state the outline of the passage. 
            By answering these questions along the way, you will gain a significantly greater understanding of the passage which will allow you to answer the 
            questions on the ACT much quicker. It will also greatly help you know where to refer back in the passage.
          </p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;">
            For example, if we look at a single paragraph, one's mental dialogue might look something like this.

              Even now, after more than fifty Strawberry Moons, finding a patch of wild strawberries still touches me with a sensation of surprise, a feeling 
              of unworthiness and gratitude for the generosity and kindness that comes with an unexpected gift all wrapped in red and green. "Really? For me? 
              Oh, you shouldn't have." After fifty years they still raise the question of how to respond to their generosity. Sometimes it feels like a silly 
              question with a very simple answer: eat them.

              <b>Who is speaking?</b> Someone speaking in first person who is older than 50.

              <b>What detail(s) stand out?</b> The strawberries are being personified: presenting themselves as a gift to the narrator.

            <p style="margin:0 0 12px 24px;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;">
              <b>What is the main idea?</b> Introduce the relationship between the main characters in the passage: the narrator and the wild strawberries.

            By doing this, we now have a clear picture of an individual near a patch of wild strawberries who wonders what they should do when encountering wild strawberries: eat them!
